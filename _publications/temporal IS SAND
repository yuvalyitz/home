We investigate the **computational and structural properties** of *Temporal Unit Interval Independent Sets* — a dynamic-graph variant of the classic independent-set problem where edges appear and disappear over discrete time steps.

Our study characterizes how temporal evolution affects interval representations and establishes **complexity and parameterized results** for finding large independent sets under temporal constraints.  
The work contributes to the growing field of **temporal graph algorithms**, connecting interval-graph theory with dynamic-network models.
