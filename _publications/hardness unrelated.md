We explore **temporal unit interval graphs**, where vertices represent time-dependent intervals and adjacency evolves dynamically over time.  
In this setting, we study the problem of finding large **independent sets**, a temporal analogue of the classical interval-graph problem.

The paper introduces structural insights and algorithmic results for this temporal variant, highlighting how temporal dependencies affect tractability and parameterized complexity.  
Our findings contribute to the growing theory of **dynamic and temporal graph algorithms**, bridging interval graph theory and evolving network models.
