## LaTeX resources

As part of the course materials, I prepared **Hebrew-compatible LaTeX templates** to help students produce clean, bilingual slides and reports.  
These templates were used for lecture presentations, homework assignments, and student submissions.

- **Hebrew LaTeX Beamer** – a minimal Beamer setup for Hebrew slides, compatible with English text and math.  
  [Open on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/hebrew-latex-beamer/kbtvhnjggbmq)

- **Hebrew LaTeX article/report template** – for homework, reports, and general documents in Hebrew.
