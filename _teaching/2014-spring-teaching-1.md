## LaTeX resources

As part of the course materials, I prepared **Hebrew-compatible LaTeX templates** to help teachers produce clean, bilingual slides and documents.  
These templates were used for maintaining lecture notes, presentations, homework assignments, and solutions.

- **Hebrew LaTeX Beamer** – a minimal Beamer setup for Hebrew slides, compatible with English text and math.

- **Hebrew LaTeX article/report template** – for homework, reports, and general documents in Hebrew.
