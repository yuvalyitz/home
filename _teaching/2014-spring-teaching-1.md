## LaTeX resources

I maintain a couple of LaTeX templates that I use in my courses and talks, especially for Hebrew documents.

- **Hebrew LaTeX Beamer** – minimal Beamer setup for Hebrew slides, compatible with English and math.

- **Hebrew LaTeX article/report template** – for homework, reports, and general documents in Hebrew.
