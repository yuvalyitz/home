### Course overview
This introductory course in algorithms and computational complexity covers sorting algorithms, data structures for efficient search, and fundamental graph algorithms.  
The final part of the course is devoted to the **P vs NP** question—one of the most profound open problems in computer science.  

Students learn to design algorithms using generic paradigms for combinatorial problems and to analyze their **time complexity** formally.

## LaTeX resources

As part of the course materials, I prepared **Hebrew-compatible LaTeX templates** to help teachers produce clean, bilingual slides and documents.  
These templates were used for maintaining lecture notes, presentations, homework assignments, and solutions.

- **Hebrew LaTeX Beamer** – a minimal Beamer setup for Hebrew slides, compatible with English text and math.

- **Hebrew LaTeX article/report template** – for homework, reports, and general documents in Hebrew.
